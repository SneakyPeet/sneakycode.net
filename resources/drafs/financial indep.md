In this post I am going to show you how easy it is to figure out how far you are from financial independence and hopefully teach you the one rule to becoming financially independent. But first a short theory lesson

What is financial independence?

Simply put, when you have enough money saved up so you can quit your job, whilst maintaining your lifestyle, without running out of money before you die.

Why would I want financial independence!

Most often the answer is retirement: At some point in the future you will reach an age where you will no longer be able to (or want to) generate an income. 

Even though it sounds nice to take off your shoes and sit on the beach until you kick the bucket, I have a feeling that you will probably get bored of that after a month or so. 

Personally I find great satisfaction when I am doing something meaningful.

I'm convinced, but where do I start

To figure out how far you are from financial independence you need to answer 2 simple questions. 

1. How much do money do I need
2. How long will it take me to get that money

So let's get started

*How much?*

The answer to this question is very simple. How much money do you spend in a month? This should include everything except money you are already saving towards retirement.
