**Fact:** I have not been blogging as often as I would have liked

**Fact:** This is because I have been working on my ***[Getting Started With ChatOps](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/chatops-getting-started)*** Pluralsight course. 

This course is a road map to getting a team up and running with ChatOps. I help you discover the benefits of ChatOps and how to get your team to actively participate in a ChatOps culture. I show you how to place information and everyday tasks in the middle of your conversation and turn your chat room into the command line for your team. Go Go Watch It Now!

**[Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com)** is an online video library focused on hard core developer training. They are great go check them out.
