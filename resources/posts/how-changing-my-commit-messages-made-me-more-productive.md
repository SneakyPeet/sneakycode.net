Confession. I sucked at writing commit messages. Messages like `Fix`, `Style Things` and `Fix Again #yolo` where common place. This did not really matter much as I was working by myself at the time, but I knew I had to start building a habit of writing better commit messages. But every time I started looking on the interwebs I found suggestions to write a heading, a proper body and some foot notes. I understand where this is useful, but working mainly on line of business applications and committing often made it seem like more of a chore than anything else. 

Then someone at work shared this post about [semantic commit messages](http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages).

*"Now that's something I can get behind",* I thought to myself. Short, sweet and easy to remember. 

What really caught me off guard was that it made me a lot more productive.

Here's what happens. Writing the prefix forces you to commit only the work related to the one thing you should be doing. Either a Feature or a Fix or a Style Change etc. So I automatically start thinking about my commit message before I start working with the code. This means that when I start working with the code, I am focused on **exactly** what needs to be done and **only** that. Then I just do it. I get it done, commit and hop on over to whatever is next.

I also get a nice looking commit history that is easily readable and I leave bigger breadcrumbs for those that come after me.

This is also a great first step to eventually writing more detailed commit messages.
