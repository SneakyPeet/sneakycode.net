So I have not posted a new blog post in a while, but don't fret! I have a bunch of Domain Driven Design and Clean Code content that I will get out to you in the next few month. Exciting stuff!

**So why so quiet?**

Well a bunch of things have been happening. And I have been creating content, just in some different places!

First of All I am a speaker at the **[jsinsa](http://www.jsinsa.com/)** conference this coming Saturday (11 July). **jsinsa** is a fun yearly javascript conference in Johannesburg and I have the privilege of sharing my experience in building a culture of [Chatops](http://sneakycode.net/getting-started-with-chat-ops/).

And in some other big news I have been working on a Chatops course for **[pluralsight.com](http://www.pluralsight.com/)** due end of July. **Pluralsight** is an online training library aimed at hardcore developer training. They are great and I am super excited to work with them. My course is halfway done and I will be sure to let you know when it is out!

I have also been giving some internal Domain Driven Design training at my [company](http://www.entelect.co.za/) and have had some interesting DDD experience in my team. I will definitely be talking about it here. This includes the [Project Template](https://github.com/SneakyPeet/SimpleDDD) that I started, testing and the problems with repositories. I'm looking forward to getting these discussions going!

See you soon!
