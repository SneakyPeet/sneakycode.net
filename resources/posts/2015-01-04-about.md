This blog is about Domain Driven Design, Clean Code and .net. It is also about being awesome ;)

I am a .net developer, living with my wife [Carmen](http://carmengouveia.me/) and kids in Pretoria, South Africa.

I learn new things everyday. I share these things here.

I currently work as a senior software engineer at [Entelect](http://www.entelect.co.za/ "Entelect").
